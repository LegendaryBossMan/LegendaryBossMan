//The switch multiple-selection statement can be sued to perform different actions based on the possible values 
//of a constant integral expression. The program LetterGrades reads an arbitrary number of integer grades from the 
//user using sentinel-controlled repetition, updates instance variables total and gradeCounter, and increments an 
//appropriate letter-grade counter for each grade entered. The output is a report containing the total of all grades 
//entered, the average of the grades and the number of students who received each letter grade.
