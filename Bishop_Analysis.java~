//The user enters either a 1 or a 2, indicating a pass or a fail, and the program outputs the user’s entry, and then calculations the number of passes (1s), 
//and the number of failures (2s). Notice the test for equality is the double-equals sign (==). This test is laced inside the while loop, and the 
//while loop runs 10 times. The counter variable, called studentCounter is initialized to 1, and the loop condition evaluates to true as long as the value of studentCounter is less than or equal to 10. 
//If the number of passes is greater than 8, the program outputs a different message than if the number of passes is less than 8.
