//The code for a JAVA application that allows a use to enter 10 numbers, print out the numbers the user has entered, and calculate the average of those 10 numbers is below. 
//Using a while loop, the program accumulates the total of the numbers in a variable called total. The program outputs the value of each number the user has entered, 
//and then averages the numbers, and outputs the average. The while loop ceases execution after 10 iterations, because of the while condition.


//Program uses class Scanner
import java.util.Scanner;

public class ClassAverage
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
//create Scanner to obtain input from the command window
    
    Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
   
//initialization phase
     //initialize the sum of grades entered by the user
     int sum = 0;
    //initialize # of grade to be entered next
     int gradeCounter = 1;

//processing phase uses counter-controlled repition
//Create a while loop to prompt for a grade, set it equal to grade, add it to total, and increment gradeCounter
    while (gradeCounter  <=10) // loops 10 times
     {
       System.out.print("Enter grade");
      int grade = input.nextInt();
       sum = sum + grade;
       gradeCounter = gradeCounter + 1;
    }

//termination phase -- get the average, use float to allow for a decimal
    
int average = sum / 10;
//display total and average grades
  System.out.printf("%nTotal of all 10 grades is %d%n", sum);
    System.out.printf("Class average is %d%n", average);
  }

//end ClassAverage
